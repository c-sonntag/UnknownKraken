r1 -> r2 -> r3
r1 cipher for r3
r1 said to r2 to send to r3
r2 receive r1
r2 send to r3 encrypted data

r1 -> r2 -> r3 -> r4
only r1 know the whole path
- r1 encrypt data with r4 pk
- r1 say to r2 "r2 -> r3 -> r4"
- r2 say to r3 "r3 -> r4"
- r3 receive r2 data but didn't know that r1 is the first relay point

through Tor network :
r1 -> tor -> r2 -> tor -> r3
